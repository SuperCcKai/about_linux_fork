关于mysql的压力测试工具mysqlslap用法在[[file:benchmark.org][这里]].
建表及存诸过程的语句 create_table.sql
mysqlslap 有--create参数
--create ="用于生成一个表，"后绪的查询
--query 用这个表做测试,这里一般是insert ,或select 或update 语句
--create 可以是几条sql语句 ，也可以是一个文件名，里面写满sql语句
但是这条语句太长，放在一个文件里,又提示$$分隔符有问题，所以只好手动建表
mysqlslap
#+BEGIN_SRC sql

#+END_SRC

向表中插入用的sql
#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  /* 使用存储过程 */
  call insert_tbl_test(1,1,1,1,1,'name','1989-01-26','ver','t','dd','dd','con','name','localhost',1);
   /* 或 */
   insert into tbl_test(  `accountId`,  `accountType`,  `playerId`,  `headHeroId`,  `playerLevel`,  `playerName`,  `logTime`,  `clientVersion`,  `clientType`,  `issuers`,  `flashPlayerVersion`,  `connectType`,  `gameServerName`,  `ipAddr`,  `onOffType`  ) values(1,1,1,1,1,'name','1989-01-26','ver','t','dd','dd','con','name','localhost',1);
#+END_SRC
测试用语句,在测试这前要用上面create_table.sql建表及存储过程。
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mysqlslap --query="call insert_tbl_test(1,1,1,1,1,'name','1989-01-26','ver','t','dd','dd','con','name','localhost',1)" --concurrency=50  --number-of-queries 10000 --iterations=3 --engine=myisam,ARCHIVE,InnoDB -uroot -proot
#+END_SRC
开50个连接共执行10000次插入操作，
进行3次测试以便数据得到max、min、avg几个值，准确一点.
并且分别测在myisam,ARCHIVE,InnoDB 引擎上的差异
测试结果没太大差别

下面不使用存储过程，而直接用insert语句的效果
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
 mysqlslap --query="insert into tbl_test(  accountId,  accountType,  playerId,  headHeroId,  playerLevel,  playerName,  logTime,  clientVersion,  clientType,  issuers,  flashPlayerVersion,  connectType,  gameServerName,  ipAddr,  onOffType  ) values(1,1,1,1,1,'name','1989-01-26','ver','t','dd','dd','con','name','localhost',1)" --concurrency=50  --number-of-queries 10000 --iterations=3 --engine=myisam,ARCHIVE,InnoDB -uroot -proot

另我不解的是直接insert竟然比使用存储过程快，不知何解

测试开不同连接数的执行速度
